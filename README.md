## Notes

The primary challenge I faced with this pre-work assignment was being initially overwhelmed by Android Studio's vast swath of customization options.
Google certainly impressed me in this regard; I can see why Android leads the industry in terms of the number of available apps.
To those completely new to application development, the IDE can seem very intimidating at first. However, that being said, the IDE does 
mirror other popular platforms, most notably Microsoft's Visual Studio. I started my academic career working in Visual studio, so the overall
layout transition was not too much of a jump. I appreciate that you can emulate numerous types of devices to ensure proper program functionality.

This was not so much of an issue but rather an inconvenience: When you are first installing Android Studio and setting up the work environment, it 
takes quite some time to install all of the necessary files, libraries and dependencies. In the first section of the assignment, I found myself
gravitating towards my own phone.

Other than these preliminary issues, I did not have any trouble following the guides provided. The creation of this app was very similar to the 
creation of a standard windows form application in Visual Studio.

When updating the README template provided, the original code, which made use of 'img src', did not work. Using such code provided a camo error message:

"Non-Image content-type returned"

There were two possible remedies I found for this issue. You could either include the gif file in the github repository and reference it through 
a relative path (though doing this would actually display the image on the page, not link to an external site), or change the syntax to use the square 
bracket operators: "[Video Walkthrough]"
